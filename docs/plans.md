## Elaboration on features

### Inventory Management

An Aras "module" to use as a concept and also keep track on my inventory.

### Export/Import Data

As I don't have the Aras Tools to do an upgrade and I think it is a good thing to have done (Migration) this.  
As it will show how relatively easy it can be done. (And I will surely learn something on the way.)  
Another reason as so that I will have the possibility to do a migration instead of an upgrade when I move from R2023 to next public Release.

### Integration Tests

Make use of [aras-test](https://github.com/polyfacet/aras-tests) as test can be useful not only for doing regression tests.  
E.g. it can be used as a tool to improve the Developer Experience (DX), "documentation", doing a TDD workflow when it feels like a good approach.
