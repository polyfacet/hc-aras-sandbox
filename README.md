# hc-aras-sandbox

A sandbox for Aras development with useful scripts

## Summary/Purpose

During my years of working as consultant of the Aras Innovator PLM application, I have been working different implementations, processes and environments.  
This project aims to collect and consolidate some of the generic parts, mostly the (powershell) scripts to handle incremental updates - but not exclusively.  
The project will be target the latest public(free) available release of Aras Innovator, currently 2023.

## Features

- Extracting the incremental changes from git
- Creating a deploy package for an increment
